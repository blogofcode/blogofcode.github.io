Here I discuss how to set up project for tvOS platform and control GUI item focus.

### Machine Learning Definition

* Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

### Supervised Learning

* Giving the algorithm the correct right answer for number of data and we want the algorithm to learn the association between inputs and outputs and give out more right answers.
* Since we are supervising the algorithm, it is called `Supervised Learning`

Eg: * Given a cost of each house with its area in your neighborhood, predicting the cost of a new house given its area.
    * Given tumor size and whether it is malignant or benign of a set of patients, give the result as malignant or benign if given the tumor size of a new patient.

Regression Problem - Variable we are trying to find is continuous

### Unsupervised Learning

* Given a data-set(without giving correct answers), (use clustering algorithm), find interesting feature or structure.
* Used in social network analysis, market segmentation, astronomical data analysis.

Eg: Cocktail party problem : given input of two sounds mixed, output these 2 different sounds separately. (can be done easily in Matlab using ICA algorithm)

### Reinforcement Learning

Make sequence of decisions, wrong or bad, over-time learn from them and output a good decision in future.

Will be posting next part.
